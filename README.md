# odin-recipes
Odin Recipes Project!
In this project I will be building a basic recipe site. 
It will contain a home page which links to various recipes.

The aim is to demostrate my ability to:
-- Set up an HTML doc
-- Use tags and pragraphs
-- Use lists 
-- Use images and links
-- Use a correct file structure
-- Use GIT and GitHub correctly
